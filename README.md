# TurtleFrogger
Frogger, but with a Turtle. 

## Description
This is a fun game I made using the turtles module, built into python 3.9.1. 
Simply run the main(.py) code and the game will launch in a new window. 
Control the turtle with the arrow keys but be careful, you can only go forward. 
If a car (one of the multicolored blocks shooting across the window) hits you, it is game over. 
If you get to the top of the window (towards the scoreboard) unscathed, you level up. 
The cars will get faster with each level up, while your turtle stays slow as a turtle. 

## Usage
You can freely access this app so long as you have a version of python 3 (this was made in python 3.9.1), the tkinter and turtle module. With those, you should simply be able to run the code and have a GUI appear with your turtle at the bottom of the window, ready to go.


## Contributing / Support
If you would like to create a PULL request, please feel free. Whether the intent be to pilfer from the code as you like some elements of the app, or to suggest improvements, you are most welcome to. If the changes are to be major, however, please open an issue first so we can discuss if/what you would like to change. Should you have a problem in doing so, please feel free to let me know (my email is on my website so please find it there in case it has changed since writing this).
